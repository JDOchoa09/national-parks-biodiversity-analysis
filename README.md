Data-driven insights through analysis, visualization, and interpretation from biodiversity data from National Parks Service, exploring species distribution, conservation status, and more across diverse park sites.

# National Parks Biodiversity Analysis

Welcome to the **National Parks Biodiversity Analysis** repository! In this project, we dive into the rich world of biodiversity data provided by the National Parks Service. Our focus is on exploring different species observed across various national park sites and deriving data-driven insights through analysis, visualization, and interpretation.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to unravel the intricate tapestry of species distribution, conservation status, and more across diverse park sites. We delve into the following key questions:

- How are species distributed in terms of their conservation status?
- Is there a higher susceptibility to endangerment among specific types of species?
- Do the variations between species and their conservation status hold significance?
- Amongst the parks, which animal holds the highest prevalence, and how is their distribution across these parks?

## Data Sources

The data for this project originates from two main sources:

- `Observations.csv`: Biodiversity observation data.
- `Species_info.csv`: Information about different species.

These datasets provide the foundation for our analyses, visualizations, and insights.

## Repository Contents

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step analysis process.
- `data/`: Directory containing the provided datasets.
- `results/`: Folder containing visualizations, interpretation, and insights derived from the analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/JDOchoa09/national-parks-biodiversity-analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd national-parks-biodiversity-analysis`
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand our analysis approach and findings.
